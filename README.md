flitsletters
============

AngularJS application to help children automate letters of the Dutch alphabet. 

In school my children, when they start learning how to read and write (which in the Netherlands is when they are 6 years old) have to practice recognizing letters and name them as quickly as possible. In the class the teachers use cards which they show to one of the kids. The kid has to respond to the letter shown. My idea was to make a simple application which selects letters from a configurable set and shows a new letter at a regular and configurable interval. At the same time I was able to play around with AngularJS and its nice MV* features. 

The letters used here are the letters of the Dutch alphabet (26 of them) and a number of other combined vowels and sounds that are important for Dutch children when they learn to read and write. 

Building the application

You need the yeoman stack (node.js, yo, bower and grunt) to build the project.
